In this particular session, we will build different models on the Training Data and then go on to check the accuracy (or error) on the training and test data. 
The model which performs the best on the test data is an optimum model for us.
The following '.csv' file Emission.csv and the data columns inside this file are 'CO2 Emission' (which denotes the Carbon Dioxide of a particular city) and 'Year' (corresponding Year-Month for the 'CO2 Emission' column).
